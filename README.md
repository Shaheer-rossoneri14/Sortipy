# Sortipy
Sort your Spotify Playlist.

Sortipy is a powerful and versatile playlist sorting tool for Spotify users, allowing for customized organization of musical collections based on a variety of musical attributes, including tempo, loudness, valence, energy, danceability, and more. This solution was created using a combination of Python-Flask and the Spotify API, leveraging the capabilities of both technologies to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience. With this tool, music lovers can easily sort their playlists, making the process of enjoying music more efficient and enjoyable.

How it works?

The application streamlines the process of organizing your Spotify playlists by utilizing a powerful combination of playlist URL slicing and the Spotify API. Upon entering your playlist URL, the application extracts the playlist URI and uses it to gather information about all the tracks in the playlist.

With the tracks selected, the application seamlessly retrieves various musical attributes for each song using the Spotify API, presenting the information in an organized table format. The user can then sort the songs according to their preferences, utilizing the intuitive sorting buttons located at the bottom of the page. This solution offers a simple, efficient, and effective way to manage your Spotify playlists
